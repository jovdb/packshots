Configuration
- Show resolution and size with image thumb in configuration
- Add support to get a spread from pvc, des
- Show warnings for background images that don't match the aspect ratio of the packshot
- Show warnings for background that are less that the packshot resolution
- Show warning is pachshot size can be higher = all fullscreen images (mask, background) have a higher resolution
- Make layer name editable (contenteditable attribute?) (edit button on hover?)
- Snapping of control points horizontal/vertical with shift key
- Spread Config needs a spread index?

Renderer
- Opacity during drag
- Cone Renderer

Storage
- Use the File System Access API?
- Save configuration
- Save fixed images (background / mask):
  - inline (base64) (for local images)
    - do we want to store inline images in json? = large json
    - Export as folder (ZIP in browser): creates an output folder with all images + config file with relative links
  - Provide a image path prefix? "http://folder-with-images/" and relative images "./Mask.png"

General
- undo/redo
- Use CSS instead of inline styling
- Isolate rendering so it can be used in Creators
- Isolate control points to projection matrix calculation, so client doesn't need that logic, only the projection matrix?
- Should images get some id in the configuration, so they can be targeted from command line?
  - Bulk Editor:
    - The spread images for each design must be passed
    - Maybe absolute imagePath should be replaced to a folder, so relative images can stay 
  - Creator:
    - The spread image must be passed
    - Other images must have url to static?
  - API
    - thumb / medium in result?
