General
- undo/redo
- Use CSS instead of inline styling
- Isolate rendering so it can be used in Creators
- Isolate control points to projection matrix calculation, so client doesn't need that logic, only the projection matrix?
- Should images get some id in the configuration, so they can be targeted from command line?
  - Bulk Editor:
    - The spread images for each design must be passed
    - Maybe absolute imagePath should be replaced to a folder, so relative images can stay 
  - Creator:
    - The spread image must be passed
    - Other images must have url to static?
  - API
    - thumb / medium in result?
